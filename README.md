# face Recognition using Python Programming Language
<br><br>
Face recognition is a method of identifying or verifying the identity of an individual using distance of various points on face. There are various algorithms that can do face recognition but their accuracy might vary. Here I am going to describe how we do face recognition using Python Programming language. So now let us understand how we recognise faces using deep learning through opencv.
<li>
We make use of face embedding in which each face is converted into a vector and this technique is called deep metric learning.

I used opencv for identification of face of a person

Modifications which can be made in the same model :
<br>
<li>
Can be used with cctv for live sessions
<li>
Can be used for the attendance capturing session
